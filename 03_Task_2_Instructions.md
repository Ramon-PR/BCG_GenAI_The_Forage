# Chatbot Prototype


Building a fully functional AI chatbot for financial analysis is a
complex process involving advanced programming and deep learning
techniques. However, to fit our learning objectives and time
constraints, we’ve tailored a simplified task. This streamlined version
will introduce you to the basics of chatbot development, focusing on
creating a prototype that responds to predefined financial queries. It’s
a first step into the world of AI chatbots, offering a glimpse into
their potential without the need for extensive development time or
advanced technical skills. Let’s begin this journey, keeping an eye on
the bigger picture while we tackle this accessible task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Preparation

1.  **Review the analyzed data:** Quickly review the financial data you
    analyzed in Task 1 to refresh your memory on what information is
    available.  
2.  **Set up your environment:** Ensure Python and essential libraries
    (like `pandas` for data handling and `Flask` for a simple web
    application, if applicable) are installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2: Chatbot Design and Data Preparation

1.  **Define predefined queries:**  
    Select 3 to 5 common financial queries (e.g.,
    - “What is the total revenue?”  
    - “How has net income changed over the last year?”)
2.  **Prepare responses:**  
    Use the analyzed financial data to create canned responses for these
    queries.  
    This step involves mapping each predefined query to a specific
    response based on your data analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3: Basic Chatbot Development

**Chatbot logic:**  
Write a simple Python script that uses `if-else` statements to match
user input (the predefined queries) to the responses you prepared.  
For a more interactive experience, consider using a basic Python library
such as `input()` for command-line interaction or a simple Flask app for
web-based interaction.

\`\`\`python def simple_chatbot(user_query): if user_query == “What is
the total revenue?”: return “The total revenue is \[amount\].” elif
user_query == “How has net income changed over the last year?”: return
“The net income has \[increased/decreased\] by \[amount\] over the last
year.” \# Add more conditions for other predefined queries else: return
“Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries.”
