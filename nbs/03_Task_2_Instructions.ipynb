    "## Chatbot Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a fully functional AI chatbot for financial analysis is a complex process involving advanced programming and deep learning techniques. However, to fit our learning objectives and time constraints, we've tailored a simplified task. This streamlined version will introduce you to the basics of chatbot development, focusing on creating a prototype that responds to predefined financial queries. It's a first step into the world of AI chatbots, offering a glimpse into their potential without the need for extensive development time or advanced technical skills. Let's begin this journey, keeping an eye on the bigger picture while we tackle this accessible task.\n",

    "### Step 1: Preparation \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the analyzed data:** Quickly review the financial data you analyzed in Task 1 to refresh your memory on what information is available.  \n",
    "2. **Set up your environment:** Ensure Python and essential libraries (like `pandas` for data handling and `Flask` for a simple web application, if applicable) are installed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Chatbot Design and Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define predefined queries:**  \n",
    "   Select 3 to 5 common financial queries (e.g.,  \n",
    "   - \"What is the total revenue?\"  \n",
    "   - \"How has net income changed over the last year?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare responses:**  \n",
    "   Use the analyzed financial data to create canned responses for these queries.  \n",
    "   This step involves mapping each predefined query to a specific response based on your data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Basic Chatbot Development\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chatbot logic:**  \n",
    "Write a simple Python script that uses `if-else` statements to match user input (the predefined queries) to the responses you prepared.  \n",
    "For a more interactive experience, consider using a basic Python library such as `input()` for command-line interaction or a simple Flask app for web-based interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simple_chatbot(user_query):\n",
    "    if user_query == \"What is the total revenue?\":\n",
    "        return \"The total revenue is [amount].\"\n",
    "    elif user_query == \"How has net income changed over the last year?\":\n",
    "        return \"The net income has [increased/decreased] by [amount] over the last year.\"\n",
    "    # Add more conditions for other predefined queries\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries.\"\n"
