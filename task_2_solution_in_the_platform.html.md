### 2. Data structuring and retrieval

**Data structuring**: Assume we have a CSV file named financial_data.csv
that stores our company’s financial information. For this example, the
chatbot’s responses are hardcoded, but in practice, you would retrieve
this information from your structured data source.

**Retrieval method**: While our example does not directly fetch data
from a file, in a more advanced scenario, you could use pandas to read
the CSV and query the DataFrame for specific information based on the
user’s input.

### 3. Communicating financial insights

- Dialogue design: The chatbot’s responses are crafted to be clear and
  informative, summarizing complex financial data into
  easy-to-understand insights. For a more interactive dialogue, you
  might expand the function to suggest related queries or follow-up for
  more detail.

#### Example interaction with the chatbot

**User query**: “What was the net income?”

**Chatbot response**: “The net income for the fiscal year 2021 was $5
billion, a 10% increase from 2020.”

**User query**: “Tell me about revenue growth.”

**Chatbot response**: “Revenue grew by 8% from 2020 to 2021, reaching
$22 billion.”

#### Conclusion and variation:

This example demonstrates the core principles of developing a financial
chatbot using rule-based logic. Depending on your depth of understanding
and technical skills, there are numerous ways to enhance and expand this
prototype. You might integrate more complex NLP features for natural
language understanding, connect to real-time financial databases for
dynamic data retrieval, or implement machine learning for more nuanced
interaction and response generation.

**Key takeaway**: The principles of chatbot development (rule-based
logic, data integration, and clear communication) apply regardless of
the complexity of your chatbot. This example provides a foundation, but
the possibilities are vast, encouraging you to explore and innovate
beyond this basic framework.
